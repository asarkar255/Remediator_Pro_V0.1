ABAP Syntax Remediation Rules
================================

Rule 1 — Replace SELECT SINGLE * with explicit field list
---------------------------------------------------------
- What to do:
  * Change `SELECT SINGLE * FROM ...` to `SELECT SINGLE <field_list> FROM ...`.
  * Prefer `SELECT SINGLE` over `SELECT ... UP TO 1 ROWS` when fetching one row by (full) key.

- Why:
  * Safer, clearer, avoids pulling unused columns and keeps result structure stable.

Examples:
Before:
  SELECT SINGLE * FROM mara WHERE matnr = lv_matnr INTO wa_mara.

After:
  SELECT SINGLE matnr meins mtart FROM mara
         INTO CORRESPONDING FIELDS OF wa_mara
         WHERE matnr = lv_matnr.  " Added By PwcYYYY-MM-DD

Before (anti-pattern):
  SELECT * FROM mara INTO wa_mara
         WHERE matnr = lv_matnr
         UP TO 1 ROWS.
  ENDSELECT.

After:
  SELECT SINGLE matnr meins mtart FROM mara
         INTO CORRESPONDING FIELDS OF wa_mara
         WHERE matnr = lv_matnr.  " Added By PwcYYYY-MM-DD


Rule 2 — Do not declare AFLE amount variables as TYPE p LENGTH 23 DECIMALS 2
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- What to do:
  * For AFLE amount fields, do not use TYPE p LENGTH 23 DECIMALS 2 (invalid: P length max is 16).
  * Use the DDIC amount element (e.g., DMBTR) always for AFLE amount variables.

Examples:
Before (wrong):
  DATA lv_amount TYPE p LENGTH 23 DECIMALS 2.   " WRONG: P length > 16 bytes

After (correct):
  DATA lv_amount TYPE dmbtr.                    " Added By PwcYYYY-MM-DD

Rationale:
- ABAP TYPE p length is bytes (1..16), not digits. LENGTH 23 is invalid.
- Using DDIC amount types (e.g., DMBTR) aligns with AFLE-compliant precision/scale and DB mappings.


Rule 3 — Do NOT add ORDER BY to SELECT SINGLE
---------------------------------------------
- What to do:
  * Do **not** append any `ORDER BY` clause to `SELECT SINGLE`.
  * If you fetch one row **by full primary key**, use `SELECT SINGLE ... WHERE <full key>`.
- Why:
  * `SELECT SINGLE` is intended for key-based, deterministic access; adding `ORDER BY` is semantically wrong and misleading.

Examples:
Before (anti-pattern):
  SELECT SINGLE * FROM mara
         WHERE matnr = lv_matnr
         ORDER BY ersda DESC
         INTO wa_mara.

After (key-based, deterministic):
  SELECT SINGLE matnr meins mtart ersda FROM mara
         INTO CORRESPONDING FIELDS OF wa_mara
         WHERE matnr = lv_matnr.  " Added By PwcYYYY-MM-DD

Rule 3 — Do NOT add ORDER BY to SELECT SINGLE
---------------------------------------------
- What to do:
  * Do **not** append any `ORDER BY` clause to `SELECT SINGLE`.
  * If you fetch one row **by full primary key**, use `SELECT SINGLE ... WHERE <full key>`.
  * If you truly need the “top” row by a sort criterion, use:
    - an aggregate (e.g., MIN/MAX) when possible, **or**
    - `SELECT <field_list> FROM ... WHERE ... ORDER BY ... UP TO 1 ROWS.`

- Why:
  * `SELECT SINGLE` is intended for key-based, deterministic access; adding `ORDER BY` is semantically wrong and misleading.
  * For ordered picks, use explicit `ORDER BY ... UP TO 1 ROWS` (and a field list), or an aggregate for clarity and performance.

Examples:
Before (anti-pattern):
  SELECT SINGLE * FROM mara
         WHERE matnr = lv_matnr
         ORDER BY ersda DESC
         INTO wa_mara.

After (key-based, deterministic):
  SELECT SINGLE matnr meins mtart ersda FROM mara
         INTO CORRESPONDING FIELDS OF wa_mara
         WHERE matnr = lv_matnr.  " Added By PwcYYYY-MM-DD

After (ordered top-1 by a criterion):
  SELECT matnr meins mtart ersda FROM mara
         INTO CORRESPONDING FIELDS OF wa_mara
         WHERE matnr LIKE lv_mat_pattern
         ORDER BY ersda DESC
         UP TO 1 ROWS.  " Added By PwcYYYY-MM-DD


Rule 4 — Comma-separated field lists: escape INTO/WHERE with @, ORDER BY uses commas
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- What to do:
  * When you list fields in `SELECT` or `SELECT SINGLE` separated by commas, you must:
    - Escape host variables in the `INTO` clause with `@`.
    - Escape host variables in the `WHERE` clause with `@`.
    - Separate fields in the `ORDER BY` clause with commas.
  * Do not leave `ORDER BY` fields space-separated when commas are used in the field list.

- Why:
  * Modern ABAP SQL syntax requires `@` escaping when host variables are used together with comma-separated field lists.
  * Ensures consistency, avoids ambiguous parsing, and enforces correct Open SQL syntax.

Examples:
Before :
  SELECT *
         INTO TABLE lt_data
         WHERE matnr IN s_matnr
         ORDER BY ersda DESC.

After (wrong):
  SELECT matnr, meins, mtart FROM mara
         INTO TABLE lt_data
         WHERE matnr IN s_matnr
         ORDER BY ersda mtart DESC.  " Added By PwcYYYY-MM-DD
After (correct):
  SELECT matnr, meins, mtart FROM mara
         INTO TABLE @lt_data
         WHERE matnr IN @s_matnr
         ORDER BY ersda, mtart DESC.  " Added By PwcYYYY-MM-DD
